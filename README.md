# CodeCamp-2.0
Rebuild of OrlandoCodeCamp.com to improve form and functionality

The new CodeCamp Web Application will seek to include the following:


* A database for storage of users (attendees, speakers, sponsors, admins), and event sessions
* Availability of information about the event and individual sessions without required registration
* Functionality to allow filtered view of sessions by users based on topic and time-slot. This functionality exists in the current version of the CodeCamp website.
* CRUD functionality for the creation of and interaction with session and schedule data between the user interface and the database
* User authentication to allow users to login and view/update only their own personal session schedule, and other profile information
* Third-party storage to allow speakers to upload their presentation/slide-decks for approval
* Some degree of analytics to track number of registrants, speakers, popularity of sessions, etc.
